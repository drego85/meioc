**Meioc** (Mail Extractor IoC) is a Python script designed to analyze emails and extract indicators of compromise (IoC) in JSON format. It is a valuable tool for security analysts, system administrators, and anyone needing to investigate suspicious emails.

## Features

Meioc allows you to extract the following information from an email:
- **Headers**:
  - From, Sender, X-Sender, To, Cc, Bcc, Envelope-to, Delivered-to, Return-Path, Subject, Date, User-Agent, X-Originating-IP.
- **Relay Information**:
  - Detailed server relay hops.
  - IP addresses involved, with an option to exclude private IPs.
- **Content Extraction**:
  - URLs found within the email.
  - Extracted domains.
  - Attachments with calculated hashes.
- **Security Checks**:
  - SPF (Sender Policy Framework) validation.
  - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) validation.

## Default keys

These are the default keys generated by Meioc, if the value does not exist a null is returned.
